# Assignment-1: Applied Pattern Recognition (APR)

## Dataset
We used the Iris dataset from sklearn (also available on UCI ML Repository).

## Algorithm
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier was applied to classify flower species.

## Steps
1. Load the dataset.
2. Split into training and testing sets.
3. Train the KNN classifier.
4. Evaluate accuracy.

## Output
The model achieved accuracy > 90% on test data.

Run the code with:
```bash
python knn_classifier.py
```
